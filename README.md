## [Scrum Is Dead. All Hail Kanban, the New King](https://betterprogramming.pub/scrum-is-dead-all-hail-kanban-the-new-king-2cd6249feef8)

#### Thoughts on article
The author of the article argues that in practice people put too much emphasis on the process of Scrum and delivering within the sprint and having your task marked as 'done' limiting than on quality. He feels that Kanban, which does not have timeboxed sprints, story estimations, or commitments, is better than Scrum and that Scrum is dead. I disagree, and I think that it really depends on your team and project on how well Scrum works. In my past internships I have used Scrum, and I found it very helpful. It helps you pace yourself, set goals, see what others are working on, and get the help you need if you run into any blocks.Unlike what is mentioned in the article, I have not experienced team members or myself rushing to deliver everything on the last day of the sprint to avoid carry overs. In my experience there can be carry overs for a number of reasons like unexpected bugs, people not reviewing pull requests, or the task itself turned out to be larger than anticipated, which can be annoying, but the carry overs were never seen as bad. They were things to learn from. I think Kanban can be useful for long term projects or projects that aim at improving the quality of an old project, but new projects or timed projects need Scrum.
